The files in this folder use jQuery. The main task remain is Closing of Dialog after postback.
Since its difficult(impossible for me ) to write code which calls javascript function after postback,
These files are left. 

The work-days for these 2 files is estimated to be 4 days. and that was worth the copying of code to new implementation in Custom folder.

Main files:: 
1.RestrictionFifth.ascx--- acts as each restriction entity
2.RestrictionMainUC --- acts as Restriction Main from where execution starts
3.TestOfUC is the last test done on above files
4.WebFormFith ===> is the aspx version of RestrictionMainUC, in fact RestrictionMainUC was created by copying whole code of WebFormFifth
and then some major modifications.
